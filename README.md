# Welcome to Full Stack Snacks

I'm JB Tellez, a full stack engineer and educator. This is where I try out new technologies.

A very cool company is using AI powered tools to empower students and educators. That's right up my alley!

They use [Remix](https://remix.run/) so I thought I'd whip up an app to try it out. It's great! Especially when combined with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and the amazing [v0](https://v0.dev/).

I got the cute (to me at least) icon from [Rendi](https://thenounproject.com/creator/rhendysikoembang/) over at [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/). Definitely check Rendi out if you're looking for cool icons.
